# LLM OS Profile
# This file defines your OS identity. On boot, the kernel reads this profile
# and generates the shell UI, core apps, and services from it.
#
# In Phase 5, the OS becomes ephemeral — everything except this profile
# and your /data directory is regenerated fresh on every boot.
#
# Copy to profile.yaml and customize:
#   cp data/profile.example.yaml data/profile.yaml

# --- Identity ---
# Who you are. This context is passed to the LLM when generating apps and UI.
name: ""
locale: en
timezone: UTC

# --- Shell ---
# How the OS looks and feels. The shell UI is generated from these preferences.
shell:
  theme: dark            # dark | light | auto
  font: monospace        # monospace | sans | serif
  layout: single         # single | tiled | stacked
  greeting: "What would you like to build?"

# --- Always-on Apps ---
# Apps generated and launched automatically on every boot.
# Each entry is a natural language prompt — the kernel generates the app from it.
boot_apps: []
  # - "a minimal clock showing the current time"
  # - "a pomodoro timer with 25min work / 5min break"
  # - "a sticky notes app with local storage"

# --- Services ---
# System services to enable on boot.
services:
  ssh: true
  ollama: true           # Start local Ollama if available
  scheduler: false       # Self-improvement scheduler

# --- Security ---
# Default security posture for generated apps.
security:
  sandbox: strict        # strict | permissive
  network: deny          # deny | prompt | allow — default network access for apps
  max_capabilities: 5    # Max capabilities per app before requiring explicit approval

# --- LLM Preferences ---
# Which provider to prefer for generation tasks.
llm:
  prefer: local          # local | cloud | fastest
  temperature: 0.7       # Default temperature for generation
  # provider: ollama     # Force a specific provider (overrides prefer)

# --- Data Persistence ---
# What survives across boots. Everything else is regenerated.
persist:
  - data/apps/           # Generated app storage
  - data/registry.json   # App registry
  - data/profile.yaml    # This file
  - data/claude-tasks.json
