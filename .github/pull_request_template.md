## What this PR does


## Values Self-Check

Every contribution must align with the core values. Check each box to confirm:

### 1. Protect the user first
- [ ] No telemetry, analytics, tracking, or data exfiltration added
- [ ] No external service calls without explicit user consent
- [ ] Sandbox isolation is not weakened (no allow-same-origin, no unsafe-eval)
- [ ] Capabilities still require user approval before granting
- [ ] Generated app code still passes through static analysis

### 2. Empower the user
- [ ] No artificial limitations, paywalls, or feature gating added
- [ ] Does not restrict what users can generate or run

### 3. Take a piece, leave a piece
- [ ] Does not remove or bypass security layers
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies added
- [ ] Existing functionality is not broken

### 4. Nothing is perfect
- [ ] Code works and has been tested
- [ ] I've run `node scripts/values-check.js` locally and it passes
